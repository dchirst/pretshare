## What is the Pret Subscription?

[Pret A Manger](https://www.pret.co.uk/en-GB) is a chain of coffee shops, mostly based in London. During the Pandemic
they announced the [Pret Coffee Subscription](https://www.pret.co.uk/en-GB/pretcoffeesub), a Â£25 per month service that
entitles you to 5 freshly made drinks a day. For people who drink *a lot* of coffee, this is a great deal.

There are some stipulations with this subscription. Namely, you must wait 30 minutes between each drink that you get.

## And what the heck is this app?

If you were to share a single Pret Subscription with other people (something that Pret expressly disallows you from
doing), this 30-minute cooling-off period presents some problems.

You must inform each other when you are getting a coffee, so that the other sharers do not try and get a coffee with the
subscription during the half-hour break. It's also a pain to coordinate who will get the next coffee, especially during
a busy workday.

This website aims to make it easier to share and coordinate the Pret Coffee Subscription with multiple people. It
includes a timer that counts down until the subscription can be used again, a reservation button to inform others that
you want the next coffee, and a counter that records the number of drinks you've had that day.

This was made as a bit of fun. Feel free to give me feedback, or let me know if you have any use for it!
